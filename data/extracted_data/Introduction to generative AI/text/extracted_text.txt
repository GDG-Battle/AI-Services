Fundamental of LLMs
[PPTX Slide 8]
What is LLM?
An LLM is a computer program that has been fed enough examples to able to recognize and interpret human language or other types of complex data.
LLM are very large models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data.
It can perform different tasks such as answering questions, summarizing documents, translating languages and completing sentences.
Large Language Model
[PPTX Slide 9]
LLM Architecture
Encoder
Models that convert a sequence of words to an embedding(Vector representation)
[PPTX Slide 10]
LLM Architecture
Decoder
Models that take a sequence of words and output next word. (Based on probability).
[PPTX Slide 11]
LLM Architecture
Encoder-decoder
Encodes a sequence of words and use the encoding to output the next word

Prompt & Prompt Engineering
The process of iteratively refining a prompt for the purpose of eliciting a particular style of response
The input or initial text provided to the model

Prompt Engineering
[PPTX Slide 13]
Basic prompt techniques
Summarize this text. Write it as a 3-bullet point summary. Make each sentence short and specific.
In-context learning: Conditioning an LLm with  instructions and or demonstrations of the task it is meant to complete
[sentence] This is great! //[sentiment] Positive
[sentence] This is really bad! //[sentiment] Negative
[sentence] That book was fantastic. //[sentiment] Positive
[sentence] That show was horrible! //[sentiment]
Use few-shot prompting and experiment with the number of examples
[PPTX Slide 14]
Basic prompt techniques
Solve this problem step by step: If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, what is its speed? Hereâ€™s how you solve it:

Identify the formula for speed: Speed = Distance Ã· Time.
Plug in the values: Distance = 60 miles, Time = 2 hours.
Perform the calculation: Speed = 60 Ã· 2 = 30 mph.
Now solve this: If a car travels 120 miles in 3 hours, what is its speed?
Chain-of-Thought:  prompt the llm to emit intermediate reasoning steps .
The model will mimic your structured reasoning.

How to customize the LLM ?
[PPTX Slide 20]
What is RAG?
It's an advanced technique
 used in LLMs.
 The model retrieves 
 relevant information from
 a knowledge base or  
 external sources.
Retrieval Augmented Generation
[PPTX Slide 21]
Vector Databases
[PPTX Slide 22]
Role of Vector Databases with LLms
Cheaper than fine-tuning LLMs which can be expensive to update
Real-time updated knowledge base
Cach previous LLM prompts/responses to improve performance .
[PPTX Slide 23]
Generation
Use the retrieved context to generate an accurate, relevant response.
Retrieval
Retrieve relevant data from the indexed sources to provide context for the modelâ€™s response.
Ingestion
This is the process of bringing external data into the system

What is Langchain?
LangChain is a framework for
 developing applications
 powered by language models.
It offers a multitude of 
components that help us
 build LLM-powered 
applications.
[PPTX Slide 31]
Use a given language model as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take .
Retaining the entire conversation(store information about past interactions).
Memory
Agents
Are AI models designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. They are trained on vast amounts of text data to predict and generate the next word .
Language agents
Interpreting or analyzing the model's output in a structured manner.
Output Parsers
